			<h1>Inspiration:</h1>
			<p> I have always loved cute wholesome comics, especially about parents and kids! There was a Webtoon I read called
			"Days With You" That I've always really loved reading, which helped inspire Leo. One of my biggest inspirations was a comic I found
			on Instagram one day that was about this busy man who finds a young boy that acts like a dog, and I really wanted to expand on
			that idea! I don't know exactly what it's called, but it was one of my biggest inspirations for this! One thing that really
			got me going on this was the recent passing of my mother. I dedicate this to her, and it really got me thinking about how Jared feels too since he lost people he loved very much.			</p>
